# FindTheMostCommonStringInAList

You can use it to find the most common string in a given list of strings or an array of strings(you might need to change the code a little bit).

For example: The input is :"test","something","foo","test","test","foo". Then the output will be "test".
Another example : The input is "test", "test", "foo","foo","somethingelse". Then the output will be "test" and "foo".

It may cause a little bit of performance problem.
Don't call the function every frame. Use it only when neccessary.
